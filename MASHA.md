Hi, hope you are doing well. 

I am not only an author of MockK, but I am as well a father of kid with cerebral palsy.

Despite the fact, 
that she can smile on pictures, 
her condition is quite severe. 
There is basically no abilities available for her and 
we have a problem even with feeding her. 

We decided to give a try for a stem cell therapy and 
need to collect some amount of money 
that we are not able to collect as a family.

So if you would like to support us, please donate via this link: https://salveazaoinima.ro/en/campaigns/maria-pilipenco/ 

As well we do have a blog(but it has problems with translation): 
https://mashaidi.blogspot.com/2017/09/blog-post.html#en
 
Remember: even small amount make the difference if it is done by 1000x people.

Thank you!
