Hi, hope you are doing well.<br>
<br>
I am not only the author of MockK, but I am as well a father of kid with cerebral palsy.<br>
<br>
Despite the fact, 
that she is smiling very cheerful on photographies, 
her condition is quite severe. 
There is basically no abilities available for her and 
we have a problem even with feeding her. <br>
<br>
We decided to give a try for a stem cell therapy and 
need to collect some amount of money 
that we are not able to collect as a family.<br>
<br>
So if you would like to support us, please donate via this link: <a href="https://salveazaoinima.ro/en/campaigns/maria-pilipenco">https://salveazaoinima.ro/en/campaigns/maria-pilipenco/</a><br> 
<br>
As well we do have a blog(but it has problems with translation): 
<a href="https://mashaidi.blogspot.com/2017/09/blog-post.html#en">link</a><br>
<br>
Remember: even small amount make the difference if it is done by 1000x people.<br>
<br>
Thank you!
