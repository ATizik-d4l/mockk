1 Thank you @oleksiyp I'm glad to see your project, for sure I'll try it in the future!

2 thank you

3 I will check it out and see. Thanks for the heads up.

-4 Nah, mockito-kotlin is better, nhaarman is awesome 

5 @********** 

6 Hi, thank you for reaching out. I will check out your framework. 

Closing the issue for now, as it is not an issue on the recipes, more something to check out. 

7 Thanks for letting us know @oleksiyp will definitely take a look at `mockk` üëç 

8 Thanks, but I see no reason to switch over to a different framework for testing. 

9 Hey @oleksiyp,

Thanks for the suggestion, for sure I will be looking to use it into new projects in the future, since now I am quite busy with some other side projects.

Hope you have a nice day and a great end of year!

10 Hi! Looks really interesting. I'll probably won't have time to try it on this particular project, but I'll definitely try it in a few others. Cheers!

11 Hi there,

Thanks for the information. I'll be sure to try it out once I get back to Android development. As of this time, the project is currently pended since I'm moving to web development.

I starred the project as requested.

Thanks!

12 Thanks I will pay attention

13 We have created an issue in Pivotal Tracker to manage this. Unfortunately, the Pivotal Tracker project is private so you may be unable to view the contents of the story. 

The labels on this github issue will be updated when the story is started.

14 Hi @oleksiyp ,
Thanks for issue, sorry for late response, starred ;)
We will definitely try your lib in near future. Thanks.

-15 @oleksiyp As the framework looks ok, this is a pretty lame way how to promote your library. Not cool man. 

16 Hi, @oleksiyp !
Sure, I'll give it a try. Thanks for the info.

17 Hey! That actually looks really cool. I‚Äôll give it a shot.

18 Hi and thanks for the comment,

I used the lib for testing a demo project for a work.

I didn't understand, which library should I start using from now on?

19 Hello @oleksiyp. Thanks, I'll check it out. It seems like a great framework. Thanks for making it!

20 Thanks you so much for your recommendation. I will give it a try to the MockK library.

21 Thanks for the invite @oleksiyp. I will consider your request to use mockk for testing my project in the future!

22 Hi @oleksiyp ,

I hadn't heard of it before. So, I replaced some tests written with mockito by mockk and apreciated it a lot. :). ‚≠êÔ∏è 

I rewrite some tests in another project too: https://github.com/*********

Thanks!

23 @oleksiyp 
Oh, It's cool! 
Cheers!

-24 Please don't do this kind of thing. If you want to change things, do a pull request. This is nothing but spam as far as I can see. 

25 Oh @oleksiyp, Thanks. i'll check to use in my current projects..

:) 

26 OK. Thank You very much @oleksiyp.
I will try it.

27 I can try this for newer projects and will get back to you if got any issues while integrating. Morever, i think you should write blog on medium or somewhere else so that more people get to know about this.

28 Thanks anyways, but this library won't be under active development so i'll just stick with what I have.

29 Hi, @oleksiyp. Very nice and interesting. 
Now I am busy, but future will use it of course and may even contribute it.

I have stared project. 

30 It sounds good to have new project for Kotlin, will take a look, thanks!

31 Hi,
thank you for suggestion, I will take a look at that. I noticed libs around Kotlin are very alive right now, so my choice is pretty much random and I will have to consider more options in the future. Your solution looks nice though!

32 Thanks, I will try it.

33 I probably won't look into it. I'm not gonna lie, those tests were mostly to just experiment with Unit tests on Android as this app is basically the first Android app I ever wrote and therefore my go to practice new stuff. I never bothered to keep the tests up to date and have for the most part stopped working on the app. It was a hobby project of mine and I was the only one working on it. It ate enough time as it is even without constantly unit testing everything.

MockK looks pretty nice though.

34 sure thing thanks for all your work! have a nice xmas :)

35 Hi,

many thanks and well done for your mocking framework for Kotlin!

We'll back to you,

36 Hey, Oleksiy!

I will check your framework, since I have been using mockito with kotlin in more projects, than this.
I am just too busy now and have currently other issues as priority.
But thank you to reaching me out and I will definitely give you a feedback ;-)

-37 This is missed call and I really dislike it. We don't use mockito.

38 thank you for Mocking framework 

39 @oleksiyp I'm so excited to see the "Chained calls" feature. Truely hit the spot.

40 Hi Olekslyp,

That framework looks pretty cool, but I currently don't need any mocking framework for any of my projects. If I do need one, I will look into it :).

-41 Please don't send spam.

42 @oleksiyp Thanks for reaching out! I'll give mockk a try and I'll reach out to you if I have any questions.

43 Thank you - I will, at some point, look at replacing my existing mocking work with your framework to see how I get on. 

44 Interesting. Looks like a nice framework. Feel free to open a pull request to migrate to it

45 Thanks for the framework, will take a look. Now closing as it is not an issue related to the library.

46 Thank, I'll try it

-47 Not going to use is regardless of the functionality.

Your shameless spam is the worst advertising I've ever seen for a library @oleksiyp  

48 Hi,

Works perfectly! 

Thank you!

-49 Dude, this is third project I'm part of where you create this issue, such promotion is not okay, especially asking to star the repo.

50 Thanks @olekiyp , already stared, it's cool, will try it.

-51 Hi,
GitHub issues are not a place for ads. You can reach me on Twitter or other means and yes I have heard of it. This is probably an inappropriate place to do so. 

52 Sure dude no prob. So is this like a pure implmentation or are you wrapping
the mockito isolation framework into a kotlin style dsl?

53 Looks nice at first glance, thanks for making me aware of it.

54 Hi Oleg

https://***** is the project I'm working now. I leveraged some ideas from *******. And MockK can be very useful for what I'm doing, thanks for sharing. 

55 Thank you for letting me know about your product.

I'm very interested in the mocking framework.

I'll try it when I upgrade "****-kotlin".

Thanks.

56 It looks interesting, but I'm concerned about the need for a Java agent to
use it. I'll certainly have a look on my next kotlin project though.

57 Hi, I'll try your framework. But I'm not a programmer, I'm doing autotesting. The probability that I will need to write unit tests is very small.

58 I'll give it a look when I get back to this project.

59 Looks nice i'll check it out üëç 

60 @******** feel free to close this not-a-bug

61 Thanks, I'll take a look at it.

This project was just a example for somebody (I do not remember who :slightly_smiling_face:) to show how Mockito works with Kotlin. I do not think I'll ever update thi project.

62 Hi Oleksiy,

I've already heard about MockK and it sounds great. Thanks for this awesome job.

I'm planning to have a look at other mocking choices for future projects. MockK is definitely one of them. I'll let you know about the progress and ask you any doubt I might have. Thanks for your help

63 hello @oleksiyp 
Thanks for the pointer! 

this project here is more focused on sourceSets and intellij interaction not particularly about the kotlin tests.  

I will definitely have on eye on that project :)

-64 Wow ! Ain't that a little bit of an invasive way to promote your framework ? Spamming all the github project you can find who use mockito-kotlin, with the same copy-pasted message ? 

65 Thanks for the tip. I am looking at Kotlin but sadly it's not totally accepted by technical management at my current company so I don't know if I will be doing a real Kotlin project anytime soon.

66 Thanks for giving the information.

67 Thanks for sharing.
But GitHub issue is not for promotion.
Please don't do this again

68 Hey there,

I've seen your library and it looks nice, but I'm sticking with Mockito for now as it's much more widespread, and I've had no issues using it with `mockito-kotlin`.

69 Hi @oleksiyp, thanks for reaching out. 

I took a look at mockk and liked a lot. I'll definitely try it when I have a chance.
